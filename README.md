# The [Thinker](http://varankin.com/?page=software/13&lang=en)â„¢ desktop application

The Thinker is a math simulator instrument to perform visual examination of numerous
computational processes running concurrently.

A math model is described as an unlimited hierarchy of math modules.
Each function or group of functions inside a module can evaluate the
result in its own computing thread. Modules exchange computed values
in asynchronous manner. Each math value can be visualized at runtime
as either a plain number or floating timeline graph.
